# Sailpoint-IIQ
    --Great way to manage and monitor identity and access of users in organization.
    --1.IdentityIQ (On Premises Identity Governance)
    --2.IdentityNow (Cloud based Identity Governance).
  
    --but IdentityIQ can still Govern Cloud based Application but it will have limited capabilities.
    
    --IAM--->Sailpoint--->IdentityIQ--->On Premise Identity Governance
    --Why IAM?
    Identity Management solutions provide complete visibility into who is doing what, what kind of risk the specific idetity or App represents and allows you to     take an Action. It Links People, Aplication, Data and device to create an Identity-Enable Enterprise.
    
   --Why ServiceNow ?: 
    Firstly, as a part of IDM ,it's a Governance System and Under Governance system we need to make sure that in a Organization all the Applications must be         onboarded based of One System which is Sailpoint.
    So, whenever somebody joins the organization HR will send data to us and we want to create an Account in all the System's(ServiceNow is also one of the         system)
    So, in that case's when people goto serviceNow, they need to have Account in ServiceNow right (who will give the Account?) Sailpoint will give the Account       to create in ServiceNow.
    As soon as some one joins the Organzation, as a BirthRight and Standerd set of application AD, ServiceNow, EmailAccount, LMS portal, So these things are         provided by the Sailpoint. And until unless people who are not having account they can't raise incident in ServiceNow, So that is the reason why we need          Saipoint for ServiceNow. 
    
   --Privileged Access Management (PAM):
         some of the top most vendors in PAM Domain are 
    1.Cyber-ark : The combination of Sailpoint and Cyber-ark provides end-end Identity Governance and provisoning with rigorous privileged Access Management
                Cyber-ark provides controlled secure access to the most critical and Highly risk priviliged accounts, while sailpoint automatically provisions                  access to these privilage accounts when directed by policy set in this system.
                Example:If an Identity changes dept or get assigned to special project the appropriate privileged accounts can be automatically changed to their                            role 
                Example:When an identity is terminated Access to these privileged accounts can be automatically disabled according to the LifeCycle policy                                  configured within sailpoint.
